Given an array of integers nums sorted in non-decreasing order, find the starting and ending position of a given target value.

If target is not found in the array, return [-1, -1].

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.
 

Example 1:
Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 8
Output: [3,4]

Example 2:
Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 6
Output: [-1,-1]

Approach:
Run a for loop and for i = 0 to n-1
Take first = -1 and last = -1 
When we find an element first time then we update first = i 
We always update last=i whenever we find the element.
