Given an integer array nums, find the subarray which has the largest sum and return its sum.
Input: nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.
First Approach:
Run a loop for i from 0 to n – 1, where n is the size of the array.
Now, we will run a nested loop for j from i to n – 1 and add the value of the element at index j to a variable currentMax.
Lastly, for every subarray, we will check if the currentMax is the maximum sum of all contiguous subarrays.
Time complexity of this approach is O(n^2).
