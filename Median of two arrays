Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays.

The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).

 

Example 1:

Input: nums1 = [1,3], nums2 = [2]
Output: 2.00000
Explanation: merged array = [1,2,3] and median is 2.
Example 2:

Input: nums1 = [1,2], nums2 = [3,4]
Output: 2.50000
Explanation: merged array = [1,2,3,4] and median is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5.

Solution:
Merge the two given arrays into one array.
Then sort the third(merged) array
If the length of the third array is even then: 
Divide the length of array by 2. Return (arr[value]  + arr[value â€“ 1] / 2).
If the length of the third array is odd then: 
Divide the length of the array by 2 and round that value and return the arr[value]
