Description:
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Approach-1:Brute Force Algorithm 
Run two loops and check for every combination in the given array.
Fix the outer loop at a specific index and move the inner loop to get all the possible pairs. The outer loop runs from i=0 to i=n-2 and inner loop runs from j=i+1 to j=n-1.
In each iteration of the inner loop check if the numbers represented by the outer and inner loop indexes add up to the target sum.
If nums[outerLoopIndex] + nums[innerLoopIndex] is equal to target, return {outerLoopIndex, innerLoopIndex}  as result. Else continue iteration to check for the next pair.
Repeat the above steps until you find a combination that adds up to the given target.
Time Complexity:O(n^2) Space Complexity:O(1).
