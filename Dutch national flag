Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.
We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.
First let us count the number of integers representing colors.
According to the color count arrange the elements 
For eg let us consider an array a[]=[2,1,0,2,0,1] here redcount=2,whitecount=2,bluecount=2
Arrange the first 2 index(redcount) with redcolor(0) and next 2 index (redcount+whitecount)with white color(1) and the rest with blue color(2).
