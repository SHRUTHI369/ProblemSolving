There are two more approaches for finding non-repeating element in an array.
One is by sorting the elements we can compare each alternate elements.
If the elements are not equal then return the i value that is the non-repeating element in an array.

The other and best approach is XOR of each element in an array.
The resultant XOR value is the non-repeating element in an array.
For eg: Let an array=[3,5,7,5,3]
Consider result=0. XOR result with each element in an array[ie.0^3=3,3^5=6...4^3=7]
The final resultant 7 is the non-repeated element.
